# BERT IDMB Review Sentiment Classification

This repo holds the example code from [A Complete Guide to BERT with Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-bert-with-code-9f87602e4a11/) for fine-tuning a BERT model on a sentiment analysis task.

This uses the [Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) that holds a collection of 50,000 online movie reviews tagged with `positive` or `negative` sentiment.

See the [Notebook](./movie-sentiment.ipynb) for more details.
